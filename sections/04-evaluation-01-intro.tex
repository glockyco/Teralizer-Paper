\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

To evaluate the primary effects, secondary effects, runtime requirements, and current
limitations of our generalization approach, we investigate the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item RQ1: To which degree does generalization affect the mutation score of the target test suites?
  \item RQ2: To which degree does generalization affect the size and runtime of the target test suites?
  \item RQ3: What are the runtime requirements of the generalization approach?
  \item RQ4: What are the causes of unsuccessful generalization attempts?
\end{itemize}

Throughout the remainder of this section, we first describe the target programs used for
the evaluation in Section~\ref{sec:target-programs}. In Section~\ref{sec:evaluation-setup},
we provide further information about the used evaluation setup, including the used hardware,
relevant pre-/processing steps, and used configuration settings of Teralizer.
Sections~\ref{sec:primary-effects-eval}--\ref{sec:filtering-eval-extended}
describe the results of the evaluation, answering RQ1--RQ4.
