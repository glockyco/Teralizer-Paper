\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper introduced a semantics-based approach
for automated test generalization,
using specifications extracted through single-path symbolic analysis
to transform conventional unit tests into property-based tests.
We implemented this approach in a prototype tool called \ToolTeralizer{}.
Under controlled conditions matching current symbolic analysis capabilities,
\ToolTeralizer{} achieves mutation score improvements of 1--4 percentage points
compared to \ToolEvoSuite{}-generated baselines.
However, our systematic evaluation across 630+ real-world Java projects
from the RepoReapers dataset
reveals substantial barriers to fully automated generalization under real-world conditions:
only 1.7\% of projects complete the processing pipeline,
and 98.3\% of assertions are excluded before reaching generalized test creation.
By analyzing these exclusions in detail,
we distinguish engineering limitations of our prototype
from fundamental research challenges in specification extraction,
providing concrete guidance for advancing the field.

The primary barrier to fully automated generalization is limited type support in existing symbolic analysis tools and approaches:
current tools cannot precisely encode constraints for strings, collections, and objects,
causing the majority of assertion-level exclusions.
As symbolic analysis improves to support additional types,
semantics-based test generalization would directly benefit.
In contrast, many other limitations of \ToolTeralizer{}
are addressable through engineering improvements
without requiring research advances:
interprocedural analysis would recover assertions in helper methods,
broader framework support would reduce test-level exclusions,
and extended constraint encoding in generated tests would improve effectiveness and efficiency
by reducing filter-and-regenerate cycles.
Our complete implementation and replication package
is publicly available to support reproduction and extension of this work~\cite{replicationpackage}.
