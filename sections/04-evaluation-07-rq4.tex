\subsection{RQ4 (Part 1 of 2): Causes of Unsuccessful Generalizations in the Evaluation Dataset}
\label{sec:filtering-eval}

In this section, we describe causes of unsuccessful generalizations in the main
evaluation dataset (commons-utils + evosuite-variants, eqbench + evosuite variants).
To get more generalizable results that enable better informed decisions about future
research directions, we also evaluated generalization success vs. failure in <number>
additional open source projects beyond the main evaluation dataset. Results of the
extended evaluation are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:filtering-eval-extended}.

\subsection{RQ4 (Part 2 of 2): Causes of Unsuccessful Generalizations in Other Open Source Projects}
\label{sec:filtering-eval-extended}

This evaluation only uses the IMPROVED$_{200}$
generalization variant, but results also apply to all other variants.

Broadly speaking, there are three main ways to increase the number of projects
that can be successfully processed: (i)~reducing exclusions caused by filtering
(129 + 3 + 269 = 401 projects), (ii)~adding support for more varied project structures
(26 + 18 + 31 + 40 + 4 = 119 projects), and (iii)~increasing timeouts (48 + 1 + 40 = 89 projects).
Depedency resolution and compilation errors in the original project code (329 + 171 = 500 projects)
as well as external tool errors (8 + 13 + 1 + 16 = 38 projects) are less actionable.
Furthermore, Teralizer errors only occur in a small number of cases (1 + 1 + 1 = 3 projects),
so also offer comparatively little opportunity for improvements.

\input{tables/tab-exclusions-filtering-extended}

The most common filtering reasons are unsupported parameter and return types.

@TODO: Better explain these filtering results by prooviding information about:
(i) which types are identified in the tested method signatures, and
(ii) which assertions are used in the tests.

Successful generalizations did not improve mutation scores in any of the successfully
processed projects. However, some generalizations indicate that there weak
preconditions are used in the source / test code of the original implementation.

@TODO: Check which generalizations fail the "NonPassingTest" filter due to (i) bugs in
our generalization implemenation vs. (ii) weak preconditions.

% Performance improvements of Teralizer itself can NOT be used as a substitute for
% (i) because the timeouts occur for tasks that are performed by external tools.
