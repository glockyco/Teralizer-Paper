\subsection{RQ3: Runtime Requirements}
\label{sec:runtime-eval}

We measured \ToolTeralizer{}'s runtime across seven project variants
to assess viability compared to existing automated testing tools.
Since no existing tools perform automated test generalization from unit tests to property-based tests,
we compared efficiency against \ToolEvoSuite{}, the established test generation tool.
Runtime results were collected on a MacBook Air with M2 processor and 24~GB of memory.
Shared processing stages were executed only once per project by \ToolTeralizer{}
and collected specifications were then reused across all seven generalization variants.
Processing required a total time of 3.4 hours for \DatasetCommonsDev{},
8.2--9.8 hours for \DatasetsCommonsEs{} projects,
and 24.8--30.9 hours for \DatasetsEqBenchEs{} projects.
Despite the relatively high runtime cost,
Pareto analysis (Section~\ref{sec:evosuite-efficiency}) confirms
that combining low search budget \ToolEvoSuite{} generation and \ToolTeralizer{} generalization
often achieves better detection-to-runtime ratios than simply running \ToolEvoSuite{} with higher search budgets.
Within the overall processing pipeline,
validation through mutation testing consumes 40.5--81.1\% of total processing time.
This concentration of computational cost in validation
indicates that future optimizations should target
the mutation testing phase rather than transformation algorithms.
