\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

Our work draws on ideas from test amplification and symbolic analysis
to automate transformation of conventional unit tests to property-based tests.
This section reviews prior approaches to test generalization
(Section~\ref{sec:rw-generalization}),
discusses research approaches and directions that could
improve specification inference capabilities of our current prototype,
(Section~\ref{sec:rw-inference})
and explores synergies with related techniques as well as adoption considerations
(Section~\ref{sec:rw-synergies}).
